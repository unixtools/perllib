Name: Local::ODBCObject
Type: module
Description: object-based interface to ODBC database, child class derived from CommonDBObject

Comments: 

See the documentation for Local::CommonDBObject for the full set of routines. This documentation
only includes specific routines that are overridden by this class and have different calling
conventions.

This module is currently windows-specific.

Name: SQL_OpenDatabase
Type: method
Description: opens a new database connection 
Syntax: $obj->SQL_OpenDatabase($db, %params)
Comments: Opens a connection to the database named in $dbname. Does not
re-open the database if the correct one is already open. Closes any currently
open database otherwise. Additional parameters can be passed using the
keys 'user' and 'passwd', whose values are the userid and password
respectively. The 'user' and
'passwd' values default to the current user, and the password from that user's
'odbc' instance as retrieved by the AuthSrv API.
