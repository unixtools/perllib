has handles for two special types of rules "before everything", and "after everything"

#
# This module provides an interface to a topological sorting
# mechanism. This code will perform a tsort as normally found, but
# with the following additional capabilities
#
# 'max' and 'min' special elements - this is usefull for when you want
# certain elements to be as early or as late as possible in the sorted
# list, but still be able to sort within the maximized or minimized
# elements. i.e. in rdist parlance "host-config" and "hostgroup-config"
# should sort after ALL elements, but host-config should sort after
# hostgroup-config
#
# The max and min elements are user-defined, defaulting to 'undef'. i.e.
# a rule "a > undef" will say that a is greater than ALL elements. Any
# rules involving max/min will be compiled into X rules indicating the
# given relation to all other elements other than other elements involving
# the same max or min.
#
# Loop handling - this code will detect loops and remove them. Any
# additional rule that is defined that would cause a loop will immediately
# be skipped.

# Name: TSort
# Type: function
# Description: performs sort according to passed-in data
# Syntax: @res = &TSort(%params)
# Comment: %params are any of the:
# Comment: rules => ref to an array of refs to sorting rules: [a,b] means that
# 	a must come before b in the resultant array
# Comment: items => ref to an array of items to sort
# Comment: extrema => define the min/max element for sorting rules
# Comment: debug => enable debugging
# Comment: This module performs a topological sort given a list of elements,
# a set of rules, and an optional 'extrema' element, which allows order
# items to the beginning or end of the list.
# If you have rules so as "[*,a]" and set "*" to be the extrema element,
# the tsort will try to order "a" as far to the end of the list as
# possible. If you have more than one rule like this, they are applied
# with the first one defined taking the most precedence.
